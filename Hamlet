Alas, poor Yorik. I knew him Horatio
A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy
He have borne me on his back a thousand times and now
How abored in my imagination it is. My gorge rises at it
Here hung those lips I have kissed i know not have oft
Where be your gibes now, your songs, your flashes of merriments that were wont to turn the table on a roar
Not one know to mock your own grinning, quite chap fallen
Not, let us take you to my ladys cahmber. let her paint an inch thick to this favour shw must come
Make her laugh at that
