Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
creeps in this petty pace from day to day
until the last syllable of recorded time
when all our yesterdays have lighted fools
the way to dudty death. Out, out brief candle
Life is but a walking shadow
a poor player tht strust and frets his hour upon the stage
until he is heard no more
it is a tale, told, by an idiot
full of sound and fury
signifying nothing
